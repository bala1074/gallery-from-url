React Boilerplate
=====================

A minimal and light dev environment for ReactJS.

### Usage

Clone the boilerplate and create your own git repo.

```
git clone git@github.com:nolotz/react-simple-boilerplate.git
```

Install the dependencies and start the server.

```
npm/yarn install
npm/yarn start
open http://localhost:3000
```

### Static Files

You can store static files like images, fonts, etc in the `build` folder.

For example, if you copy a file called my_image.png into the build folder you can access it using `http://localhost:3000/build/my_image.png`.
